This is a fork of the [ESP-IDF TUSB HID example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/usb/device/tusb_hid) that adds an LED strip which blinks blue when a key (the "f" key) is sent. The application sends the key periodically every 1 second, which can be turned off by pressing the BOOT button on the board. It starts off with the sending disabled. The LED strip is connected to GPIO 38 (usually the devkit RGB LED PIN for ESP32-S3).
